						"This is one of the best movies of the decade, showing the emotion that comes with being a human, and the vulnerability of being a man. In this thriller, we meet our young hero, Tyson. As he walks the fields of his home, he encounters a blue snail. He decides to take him home, only to release him shortly after. As he awakes in the middle of the night, he sees that snails are entering his home, only to turn him into a snail."
